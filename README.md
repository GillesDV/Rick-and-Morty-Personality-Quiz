# Rick-and-Morty-Personality-Quiz
Find out which character you are, from the tv show Rick and Morty

The Quiz consists of 10 questions, each with 3 answers. 
At the end the choices are tallied up and the system calculates which answer suits which character. 
In the end the result is always a Jerry. Because only a Jerry would do a quiz to find out if he's Rick or something.
